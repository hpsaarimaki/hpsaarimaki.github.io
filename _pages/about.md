I am a junior faculty member in the Human Information Processing Laboratory at Tampere University, Finland. I combine behavioral and neuroimaging data, naturalistic stimuli and multivariate analysis methods to understand the neural basis of human emotions. I am especially interested in characterizing the individual variation in emotions and the flow of emotions during social interaction.

I completed my PhD in cognitive neuroscience at Aalto University, Finland, in 2018. During my thesis work, I demonstrated that different emotions can be decoded from brain activity and connectivity patterns. In my postdoctoral work, I continued to characterize the content of these neural patterns in more detail and across the life-span. I am especially interested in modeling emotion-related behavioral and neural changes under naturalistic conditions. For this, my current research combines emotion elciitation using movies, virtual reality, and social interaction paradigms with brain imaging (fMRI and fNIRS), eye tracking, and physiological measurements.

In my current teaching position, I am responsible for the statistical and research methods curriculum and teaching for undergraduate psychology students at Tampere University. I also support doctoral students and faculty members in univariate and multivariate statistical methods through workshops and individual consulting.
