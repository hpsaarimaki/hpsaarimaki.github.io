About me
===

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Human Information Processing Laboratory at Tampere University, Finland. I combine behavioral and neuroimaging data, naturalistic stimuli and multivariate analysis methods to understand the neural basis of human emotions. I am especially interested in characterizing the individual variation in emotions and the flow of emotions during social interaction.

I completed my PhD in cognitive neuroscience at Aalto University, Finland, in 2018. During my thesis work, I demonstrated that different emotions can be decoded from brain activity and connectivity patterns. In my current postdoctoral work, I am characterizing the content of these neural patterns in more detail and across the life-span. I am especially interested in modeling emotion-related behavioral and neural changes under naturalistic conditions. For this, my research combines movies and narratives during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Currently, I am a visiting researcher in the Emotion and Social Cognition Lab at California Institute of Technology.
